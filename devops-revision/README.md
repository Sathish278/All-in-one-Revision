# DevOps Revision Hub

This folder is a curated index and study hub for DevOps revision material found in this repository. It organizes existing content into focused sections so you can quickly review topics.

Notes
- This hub links to original files — originals are not deleted. If you want files moved/merged into this hub, say so and I'll consolidate them.

Top-level sections

- Cloud/
- Containers/
- CI-CD/
- IaC/
- Monitoring/
- Scripting/
- Linux/
- Networking/
- Git/
- Interviews/
- Cheatsheets/
- Templates/
- Labs/

Open a folder and read its `INDEX.md` to jump straight into material.

Note: topic READMEs have been moved to a top-level `devops-topics/` folder for easier access (mirrors `devops-exercises/`). See `../devops-topics/INDEX.md` for the interview-ready topic list.
