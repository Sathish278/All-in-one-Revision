# DevOps Revision Hub

Purpose
-------
This folder is your curated study hub for DevOps/SRE revision. It organizes concise, interview-focused notes, cheatsheets, and templates so you can review and revise efficiently.

What you'll find here
---------------------
- Topical folders (Cloud, Containers, CI-CD, IaC, Monitoring, Scripting, Linux, Networking, Git, Interviews, Cheatsheets, Templates).
- Consolidated local READMEs with interview-focused summaries (lightweight, original content).
- Pointers to the large exercise corpus available as an external submodule (`devops-exercises/`) and the top-level `devops-topics/` interview READMEs.

How to use this hub
-------------------
1. Start at the top-level index files inside each folder (open `INDEX.md` under a topic).
2. For short, interview-ready theory and examples, open the topic READMEs under the top-level `devops-topics/` folder (recommended).
3. For hands-on exercises and additional examples, follow links from `devops-revision/external/INDEX.md` to the `devops-exercises/` submodule (kept upstream).

Navigation (quick)
------------------
- Top-level topics: Cloud/, Containers/, CI-CD/, IaC/, Monitoring/, Scripting/, Linux/, Networking/, Git/, Interviews/, Cheatsheets/, Templates/
- Interview READMEs (top-level): `devops-topics/INDEX.md`
- Exercises (external): `devops-exercises/` (submodule)

Contribution and editing
------------------------
- These READMEs are authored to be original and license-safe. If you want to copy or adapt content from the `devops-exercises` submodule, recreate it in your own words and keep attribution where required.
- To add or edit a topic: update or create files under `devops-topics/` for interview notes, or add cheatsheets/templates under `devops-revision/cheatsheets` and `devops-revision/templates`.

If something should be moved here from elsewhere in the repo, tell me which files and I'll consolidate them.
