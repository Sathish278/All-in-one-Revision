# DevOps Topics (interview-ready)

Purpose
-------
This folder contains original, interview-focused READMEs for high-value DevOps, SRE, and platform topics. Each topic file is written to be concise, example-driven, and suitable for last-minute revision before interviews.

How this folder is organized
----------------------------
- Each topic has its own subfolder with a `README.md` (for example, `devops-topics/kubernetes/README.md`).
- Use `devops-topics/INDEX.md` as the table of contents to jump to a topic.

Reading workflow
----------------
1. Start with `devops-topics/INDEX.md` and pick a topic.
2. Read the topic README for architecture, key concepts, short examples, and interview Q&A.
3. When you need exercises or extended examples, follow links to the `devops-exercises/` submodule or the `devops-revision/external/INDEX.md` pointer file.

Contributing
------------
- Keep notes concise and example-driven. Prefer small, copy-pasteable YAML/CLI snippets.
- Avoid copying third-party content verbatim from `devops-exercises`; instead write original summaries and link to upstream for exercises.

Suggested order for study
------------------------
1. kubernetes
2. prometheus
3. grafana
4. terraform
5. aws
6. docker
7. helm
8. argocd
9. github-actions
10. opentelemetry

If you want, I can generate a printable study-plan that pulls these in the recommended order.
